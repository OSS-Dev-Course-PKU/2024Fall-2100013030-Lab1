# OSS_Dev_Course_2024Fall Plan

Veni, vidi, vici.

I use; I donate; I contribute.

XD

### projects to contribute in plan

[meme-generator](https://github.com/MeetWq/meme-generator): Just interesting. Can be contributed by uploading meme template pic or fixing bugs.

[catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin): A pastel theme (or color set?). Contributed by porting the color theme to new programs.

[fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell): A Unix shell written in Rust. Fast and cool. Maybe not so easy to contribute.

[rustdesk-server](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server): A remote desktop software. Also written in Rust. I'm using it now. Filled with bugs to be fixed.

### That's all.
